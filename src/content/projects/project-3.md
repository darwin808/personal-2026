A high-performance logger reimagined in Rust, offering the same familiar API as pino.js with dramatically improved speed and reduced memory footprint. Designed as a drop-in replacement for performance-critical applications.

Leverages Rust's zero-cost abstractions and memory safety guarantees to deliver production-grade logging with minimal overhead. Ideal for microservices and high-throughput systems requiring reliable, fast logging.
