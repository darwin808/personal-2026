An intelligent web scraping tool that transforms any website into an interactive Q&A system. Leverages local LLM models through Ollama for privacy-focused document querying without relying on cloud APIs.

Built as a proof-of-concept for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) implementations, enabling natural language queries over scraped web content with complete data sovereignty.
